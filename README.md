# Bridge Digital Divide Africa – Kids STEM Projects

Welcome to the official repository for hands-on coding and electronics projects developed by **Bridge Digital Divide Africa**. This initiative aims to bridge the digital literacy gap in Africa by introducing children (Grades 3–12) to **STEM**, using fun, age-appropriate projects built with **Scratch** and **Arduino**.

## 👩🏽‍🏫 Who It's For
- Grade 3–6: Visual programming using Scratch
- Grade 7–12: Physical computing using Arduino (block and text-based coding)

## 🌍 Our Mission
To empower the next generation of African innovators by equipping them with practical digital and technological skills.

## 📁 What's Inside
- `scratch/` – Beginner-friendly Scratch projects (games, animations, quizzes)
- `arduino/` – Electronics and sensor-based projects using Arduino
- `curriculum/` – Suggested teaching plans, assessments, and weekly breakdowns

## 💡 Contribution
Educators and developers are welcome to contribute to this open repository and help us reach more children across the continent!
